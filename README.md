# Teach-OS

The content here was created by Prof. Badri for an introductory course on operating systems
I took at IIIT Bangalore in Spring 2024.

There is an attempt to use makefiles, sometimes in different formats to
encourage students to think about how makefiles work.


Not all the code is perfect, but most of it works quite well. Also the intention
students will pick up the code, modify and experiment with it.
A lot can be improved and it is perhaps best left to students to figure out 
issues and fix them :-)
